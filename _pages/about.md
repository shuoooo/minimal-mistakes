I am currently a fourth-year Ph.D candidate in the [Department of Computer Science and Engineering](http://www.cs.sjtu.edu.cn/) at [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](http://www.sjtu.edu.cn/), China. I have been working in the Advanced Network Lab (ANL) under the supervision of Prof. [Fan Wu](http://www.cs.sjtu.edu.cn/~fwu/) and Prof. [Guihai Chen](http://cs.nju.edu.cn/gchen/). I received my Bachelor degree of Computer Science and Engineering from Shanghai Jiao Tong University, in 2014. Right now, I am visiting the [Data Mining and Machine Learning lab](http://dmml.asu.edu/) (DMML) in Arizona State University, mentored by Prof. [Huan Liu](http://www.public.asu.edu/~huanliu/) (IEEE Fellow).

My research interests include: Mobile Computing, Applied Machine Learning, Recommender System, Wireless Networking, and Mechanism Design. You may find my website  [here](https://sites.google.com/site/yangshuo9999/).
