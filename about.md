### More Information

I am currently a fourth-year Ph.D candidate in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, China. I have been working in the Advanced Network Lab (ANL) under the supervision of Prof. Fan Wu and Prof. Guihai Chen. I received my Bachelor degree of Computer Science and Engineering from Shanghai Jiao Tong University, in 2014. Right now, I am visiting the Data Mining and Machine Learning lab (DMML) in Arizona State University, mentored by Prof. Huan Liu (IEEE Fellow).

My research interests include: Machine Learning, Data Mining, Mobile Computing, Urban computing, Wireless Networking, and Mechanism Design. Specifically, I have been working on fake news detection on social media, user and quality modeling for big data, and multi-armed bandit algorithms. I used to work on user selection and coordination in mobile computing, and resource allocation in wireless networks based on algorithmic game theory and optimization methods.
